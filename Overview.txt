Summary:
The most challenging part of this assignment was trying to understand
the different functors and how their different types were related. I'm 
still not sure I really understand how some of them work. The biggest 
challenge I had in implementing the assignment was that when I was
presented with the barebones code for the assignment I had no idea where
to start. I didn't have time to implement remove for tree dictionaries
and I did not have time to test any of the code formally.
Desgin,Implementation, Testing: 
When chooseing my RI for the List dictionary I thought that if I implemented
it in order with no duplicate keys I would benifit because I could make
my Set easier to implement. Because he RI for the 2-3 tree and the 
List were the same it made the set much easier to think about.I tried to
make the majority of my functions tail recursive. Unfortunately I ran out
of time and was not able to fully test my code but I was able to get it 
running in utop and ListEngine appeared to be working.
Division of labor:
All me.
Known Problems: The majority of the code isn't properly tested and Tree
dictionary isn't fully implemented.
Comments:
I probably spent about 30 hours on this assignment. A good portion of 
that time was spent trying to figure out what the code given to us meant 
and how you use it or implement it. Def
